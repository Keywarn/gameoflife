# 18-11-02

* created a git repo

## Structure

* maybe better to split into rows rather than squares (image processing works over rows)

## Start

* writing game of life w/o concurrency
    * image -> 2D array
    * check each cell individually (slow)

# 16-11-16

* game of life works (not parallel)

# 30-11-16

plan:

* concurrency via rows
* ^ with compression
* ^ with servers?
* ^ random cores

# TODO

[] Add timing
[] Add more than one round
[] Split into rows
